  subSpeciesIds: [12392]
  summary:
    text: The greatest challenge to both forest elephants and savannah elephants today is illegal killing to feed the ivory trade. Between 2010 and 2012 alone, some 100,000 were poached across the continent. In some parts of Africa, habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation are also threats, as is human­-elephant conflict.

  title: Asian Elephant
  subSpeciesIds: [7140]
  summary:
    text: The greatest threats to Asian elephants are habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, illegal killing, and the loss of genetic viability resulting from small population size and isolation. As a result, Asian elephants now occur on only about 10% of their historical range and many of the remaining populations are both small and isolated.

bison:
  title: Bison
  subSpeciesIds: [2815]
  summary:
    text: Today, bison are absent from most of their former range, and in terms of ecological function, they are losing ground. With our partners, we're developing tools, techniques, and information to further our understanding of bison restoration. We're building communities of practice around these efforts. And we're strengthening outreach, providing education, and informing policy to support bison recovery.

bonobo:
  title: Bonobo
  subSpeciesIds: [15932]
  summary:
    text: Bonobos are our closest living relatives alongside chimpanzees—we share 99% of our DNA with them. Yet bonobos are perhaps the least known of the African great apes and time may be running out for us to correct that. In 2013, researchers from WCS and elsewhere reported that, due to human encroachment and poaching, only about one-fourth of the bonobo's historic range remained viable.

  title: Cheetah
  subSpeciesIds: [219]
  summary:
    text: Cheetahs have disappeared from vast tracts of their historic range. In Africa they are now known to persist in only 10% of their historic range, while their distribution in Asia is limited to the central deserts of Iran.

chimpanzee:
  title: Chimpanzee
  subSpeciesIds: [15933]
  summary:
    text: Chimpanzees, our close relatives, play a vital role in maintaing the diversity of Central Africa's forests. The large seeds they eat and disperse are too big for most other animals. Without them, and their fellow great apes and elephants, these forests would be irreversibly changed.

  summary:
    text: Graceful residents of the canopies in many tropical Asian rainforests, gibbons are also wondrous singers whose morning calls fill the forests with sound. Gibbons are under immense threat, both from habitat loss and from hunting for traditional medicines and the pet trade.

gorilla:
  title: Gorilla
  subSpeciesIds: [9404, 39994]
  summary:
    text: Beyond insecurity, the main threats to gorillas are hunting (especially for bushmeat), habitat loss, and disease (namely Ebola). Also, gorillas' very slow reproductive rate means that if an adult is killed, it takes over a decade to replace him or her as a breeding individual.

jaguar:
  title: Jaguar
  subSpeciesIds: [15953]
  summary:
    text: Jaguars need large spaces to hunt an intact prey base. The home range of this top predator, across parts of North, Central, and South America, is determined by the density and biomass of its prey. Thus, its status can serve as a signal of the conservation status of the larger landscape. Ideally, jaguars have room to safely roam, but human encroachment has meant that forests are being cleared, their natural prey is being depleted, and the land is being fenced off.

lion:
  title: Lion
  subSpeciesIds: [15951]
  summary:
    text: In Africa, lion numbers are falling fast, due mostly to hunting by humans. Lions usually hunt at dusk or dawn and play an important role in savannas, removing sick and diseased ungulates from the population and keeping their populations healthy as a result. But human population growth is a serious threat, as more and more of the lions' habitat outside national parks is taken for farmland and livestock production, and populations of prey, like antelopes, buffaloes, and zebras, dwindle.

orangutan:
  title: Orangutan
  subSpeciesIds: [120588639, 121097935, 17975]
  summary:
    text: As more of the organgutan's habitat is logged or converted to palm oil plantations, orangutans continue to decline. Adding to their vulnerability, these apes produce only one offspring every five years or so, live at low densities, and require large home territories—a problem as human activities increasingly fragment their jungle habitats.
